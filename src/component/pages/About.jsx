          We aim to compare prices from every credible online retailer in NIGERIA.
          To do this is no mean feat and takes a lot of work behind the scenes to
          make sure all the products match up and the information is correct.
          Some retailers work with us directly, providing all the prices and
          item details and paying us a small amount for shoppers that click on
          their listings on PriceBay. These retailers work transparently with us.
          For these retailers, we show an icon next to all their listings.
          Some other retailers don’t work directly with us but we’re still able
          to compare their prices by scraping information directly from their
          site. Obviously, we don’t have such a close
          relationship with these shops so we can’t be as confident about the accuracy
          of their prices or help out with customer service issues. This doesn’t mean
          that you shouldn’t shop with them but it’s worth checking the details thoroughly
          before you buy. We do our best to make sure everything we list on site is accurate
          but we’re only human so if you do spot any mistakes then
          please let us know by emailing &nbsp;

          <p>
          Millions of successful online transactions happen every day, but it’s
          always important to use common sense when you're shopping online.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Look for the padlock</strong>
            <br />
            <br /> Whenever you shop online you should be taken to a secure
          payment page displaying a padlock icon and usually with https in the
          website address. Don't buy anything from a site that doesn’t display a
          padlock as it may not be a secure site. Warning signs Sites that seem
          unprofessional, are full of spelling mistakes, don't list their
          contact details, or make sweeping price promises that seem too good to
          be true are best avoided. Always trust your instincts. For more
